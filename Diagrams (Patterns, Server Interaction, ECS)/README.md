# Class Dependency Diagramming Portfolio
Hello and welcome to my class dependency diagramming portfolio! Here, I've showcased my proficiency in designing and illustrating the intricate relationships between classes and modules for a game. I've chosen four diagrams that represent specific features of the game to demonstrate the depth and breadth of my skills.

## 1. Registration module
**Description:**
The registration module diagram is designed to represent the user's journey from the start of the registration process to its completion.
**Key Features:**

- Utilizes the State Machine Pattern.

- Clearly depicts the various states a user goes through, such as: 

  - *Email waiting*,
  - *Email sent*,
  - *Registration code waiting* and more.
  

This approach ensures that the registration process is intuitive and seamless for the user, while also being maintainable and scalable from a development perspective.
## 2. Quests
**Description:**
This diagram provides a comprehensive view of the quests feature, detailing how quests are structured, initiated, and completed.

**Key Features:**

- Describes the interaction with the server.
- Illustrates how information from the server reaches the game directly.
- Ensures that quests are dynamic and engaging for the player.

## 3. Battle Scheme
**Description:**
The battle scheme diagram offers a deep dive into the mechanics of in-game battles, showcasing the flow of battle events and interactions.

**Key Features:**

- Highlights the server-game interaction.
- Provides a clear understanding of how battles are initiated, progressed, and concluded.
- Ensures that battles are both challenging and rewarding for players.
  ## 4. Skill Strategies
**Description:**
For the skills feature, I've designed a diagram that emphasizes the flexibility and diversity of in-game skills.

**Key Features:**

- Implements the Strategy Pattern.
- Demonstrates that any skill can be invoked using the same method by passing parameters like skill id, initiator unit, target unit, and cast duration.
- Despite the uniform method of invocation, the visual representation of each skill is distinct and unique.
- This approach ensures that adding new skills or modifying existing ones is a streamlined process, while also providing players with a rich and varied gameplay experience.
